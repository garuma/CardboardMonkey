# Google Cardboard

This component allows you to create stereoscopic applications that are designed to work with the Google Cardboard (http://g.co/cardboard) platform.

Google Cardboard is a simple, affordable and open virtual reality system based on off-the-shelves parts and using an Android phone for the heavy lifting.

You can visit the [official website](http://g.co/cardboard) for information on how to build your own Cardboard shell. Alternatively, pre-assembled versions are available from several online retailers.

The Cardboard SDK contains several helpers that make it easy to build stereoscopic-aware apps with OpenGL ES like `CardboardActivity` and `CardboardView`.

It also gives you access to the specifities of the platform like for instance the magnetic latch input with the `MagnetSensor` class.

You can visit [Google Developer website](https://developers.google.com/cardboard/overview) for more information about the Cardboard SDK.
